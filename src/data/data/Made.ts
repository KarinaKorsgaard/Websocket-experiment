The aim of the project is to create a unified expression of the Sydney Opera House and deepen the visitor experience. The final concept was developed on the basis of having identified 3 main reasons people come to the house. To see the house itself, to see a show, or to enjoy the view while eating at one of the house restaurants and bars. This resulted in a concept implementing both architectural, engineering and design solutions to emphasize this trinity:'
